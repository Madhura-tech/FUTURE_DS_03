# 🎓 College Event Feedback Analysis  
**Data Science & Analytics – Task 3 (Future Interns)**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes student feedback collected after college events using structured rating data.  
The goal is to understand student satisfaction levels and provide actionable insights to improve future campus events.

The analysis focuses on **quantitative feedback (ratings)** and uses Python-based data analysis techniques in Google Colab.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze student feedback ratings across multiple evaluation criteria
- Identify strengths and areas for improvement in college events
- Visualize feedback trends using charts
- Provide data-driven recommendations for event organizers

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Google Colab**
- **Python**
- **pandas** – data manipulation
- **matplotlib & seaborn** – data visualization

---

## 📂 Dataset
- `student_feedback.csv`
- Contains numeric ratings provided by students for different feedback criteria such as:
  - Subject knowledge
  - Concept clarity
  - Presentation quality
  - Overall delivery

---

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning (removal of unnecessary index column)
- Descriptive statistics of feedback ratings
- Average rating analysis per feedback criterion
- Visualization of rating trends using bar charts and histograms
- Overall satisfaction score calculation

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Students rated subject knowledge and clarity highly
- Presentation and delivery aspects received comparatively lower ratings
- Overall satisfaction scores indicate a positive response to college events

---

## 🎯 Recommendations
- Improve presentation techniques and delivery style
- Include more interactive elements during events
- Continue collecting structured feedback for continuous improvement

## 📁 Repository Contents
- `College_Event_Feedback_Analysis.ipynb` – Google Colab notebook with analysis
- `student_feedback.csv` – Dataset used for analysis
- `README.md` – Project documentation

---

## 📌 Note
This project uses **rating-based feedback analysis**.  
Sentiment analysis was not applied as the dataset does not contain textual feedback.
